# Movie-Recommendation-System
The provided information details a web-based movie recommendation engine built using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

# Concept:

Recommends movies based on collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation technique.
The underlying idea is that users who liked similar movies in the past are likely to enjoy similar unseen movies.

# Technologies Used:

# Web Technologies:
HTML: Structures the content of the web page.
CSS: Defines the style and layout of the web page.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the web page.
Bootstrap: A popular framework for responsive web design.
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application.
#Machine Learning Libraries (Python 3):
NumPy: Provides numerical computing functionality.
Pandas: Used for data analysis and manipulation.
SciPy: Offers scientific computing tools and algorithms (including matrix factorization).

# Database:

SQLite: A lightweight relational database management system used to store movie data and potentially user information.

# Requirements:

Python 3.6
pip3 (package installer for Python)
virtualenv (used to create isolated Python environments)

# Running the Engine:

Extract the downloaded files.
Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted directory.
Create a virtual environment using virtualenv (specific command depends on your operating system).
Activate the virtual environment.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Navigate to the src directory.
Run the server using python manage.py runserver.
Access the recommendation engine in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
